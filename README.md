# Homage_site Project

## A homage of [disney.co.uk](https://www.disney.co.uk/) using html, css and scss

I've only just about finished it so I know the code could probably be neater (I assume there's repeated code in the breakpoints somewhere).

I couldn't get hold of Disney's font (InspreTWDC) anywhere so I used the closest I could find, which is annoying as it throws things slightly out!

As we are unable to program clicks on CSS (as far as I am aware) I made the mobile menu open on hover, to try and replicate the click behaviour.

There are 2 carousels which actually look broken on the real site, rather than try to replicate something with images half off the page, I decided to make it neater (maybe even better! ;) so these aren't identical.

By the time you read this some content will have changed on the site, hopefully not too much. It has thrown me out a few times!
